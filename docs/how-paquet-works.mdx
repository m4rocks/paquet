# How Paquet works

Paquet is a web app built for speed and efficiency to help you find web apps.

## What makes Paquet fast

You probably noticed that most interactions happen almost instantly. This is due
to local caching and other optimizations.

Most of the pages in Paquet are entirely static, not running any client-side JavaScript
with only some elements needing interaction.
